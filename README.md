# QA-Practical-Task

Under the e2e, there is 2 scenarios. The acceptance criteria bullet pointed, so I differantiate the scenarios. Of course i could get all the login credentials and use tham in a scenario.
e.g. First see the invalid credentials can't log the system, validate the error message
then provide valid credential, login and see the Hallo text


I use Cypress in my current project in a different way but i wanted to keep it simple so i use cypress generated files.
